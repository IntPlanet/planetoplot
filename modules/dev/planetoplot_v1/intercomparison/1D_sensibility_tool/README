##

# IT IS VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO RUN THIS SCRIPT
# IN A LOCAL DIRECTORY OF THE PLANETO SERVERS (levan, viccaro, penn, under /home/local_home)
# AS THE 1D MODEL RUNS HUNDREDS OF TIMES FASTER THAN ON NETWORK DISKS (/u, /planeto, /d..., /san ...)

## Requirements:

# You must have in the same folder as probe.sh:
# - callphys.def
# - traceur.def
# - z2sig.def
# - run.def
# - a profile file if you use the corresponding mode in run.def
# - the executable to test, i.e. testphys1d.e

## Variable definition:

# The variable to be explored must be set to a dummy value in callphys.def 
eg: tauvis=999
# The user must change the sed command in probe.sh to replace this value as desired
eg: 
sed -e s/'tauvis=999'/'tauvis='${TAU[ $i ]}/g r$i/callphys.def > r$i/callphys.def.tmp ; \mv r$i/callphys.def.tmp r$i/callphys.def

with:
taus="0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0"
TAU=($taus)

## Preparation

# The cleaning and creation of directories where the 1D will be run is done by the following command:

./probe.sh prepare
# (make sure your probe.sh is executable, or type in chmod a+x probe.sh)

## Running the comparisons

# runs are launched with the following command:

./probe.sh run

## Analyse the results

# results are analysed with the following command:

./probe.sh analyse
# png or eps can be specified as a second argument, eg "./probe.sh analyse eps"
