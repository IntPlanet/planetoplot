### Note


The tutorial files `.ipynb` can only be opened by `ipython notebook`.
But `ipython notebook` is only necessary for interactive use
of those tutorials.


Static versions with figures can be displayed with a simple web browser thanks to `nbviewer.ipython.org`

[All tutorials can be found here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aymeric-spiga/planetoplot/tree/master/tutorial/)


Static versions without figures are stored in the `.py` files in this folder
